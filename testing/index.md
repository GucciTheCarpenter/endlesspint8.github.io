## Issues with Embedded Lists in MD

1. Having nothing to say.

  * Nothing's changed, so I'm not sure what was holding me back to begin with. The worth of what I have to say will vary, no doubt toward the lower value end in the beginning especially. Only with getting some reps in, putting in the practice, will anything worthwhile come to fruition.  

2. Not enough time.

  * I feel this is a legit concern and a strong indicator of what you deem important at the time. That was not meant to sound dismissive or insensitive. Whether you're wasting time or maximizing your talents what it is you **actually do** with your time is the best measure of what you've decided to value. I've had time commitments of all shades of legitimacy, from the productive (pursuing education) to the questionable (drinking beer), back to the productive again (drinking beer; I now consider it research).
